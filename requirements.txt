# C++ Project Dependencies (BASED ON CMakeLists.txt - NEEDS MANUAL ADJUSTMENT)
# This file is NOT a typical Python requirements.txt.
# It lists C++ dependencies and provides hints on how they are managed.
#
# MANUALLY REVIEW AND UPDATE THIS FILE IF YOU CHANGE YOUR DEPENDENCIES!

# --- Platform: Windows (Vcpkg) ---

# ---- Notes ----
# 1.  Ws2_32 is linked only for Windows builds (CMakeLists.txt handles this).
# 2.  Boost version MUST match what's installed via Vcpkg.
# 3.  The Vcpkg triplet is x64-windows.
# 4.  Refer to CMakeLists.txt to see how dependencies are found and linked.
